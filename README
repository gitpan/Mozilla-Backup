SYNOPSIS
      $moz = Mozilla::Backup->new();

DESCRIPTION
    This package provides a simple interface to back up the profiles of
    Mozilla-related applications.

    new
          $moz = Mozilla::Backup->new( log => $log );

        Creates a new Mozilla::Backup object. $log is an optional
        Log::Dispatch object.

    found_profile_types
          @types = $moz->found_profile_types();

        Returns a list of applications for which profiles were found. (This
        does not mean that the applications are installed on the machine.)

        Supported profile types:

          firefox
          mozilla
          sunbird
          thunderbird

    ini_file
          $file = $moz->ini_file($type);

        Returns the profile INI file for that type.

    profile_names
          @names = $moz->profile_names($type);

        Returns the names of profiles associated with the type.

    profile_path
          $path = $moz->profile_path($type,$name);

        Returns the pathname of the profile.

    profile_is_relative
          if ($moz->profile_is_relative($type,$name)) { ... }

        Returns the 'IsRelative' flag for the profile.

    profile_section
          $section = $moz->profile_section($type,$name);

        Returns the "ini_file" section of the profile.

    backup_profile
          $file = $moz->backup_profile($type,$name,$dest,$arch);

        Backs up the profile as a zip archive to the path specified in
        $dest. (If none is given, the current directory is assumed.)

        $arch is an optional name for the archive file. If none is given, it
        assumes type-name-date-time.zip.

        If the profile is currently in use, it may not be backed up
        properly.

    restore_profile
        Not yet implemented.
