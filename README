Installation
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the
    newer Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

      perl Build install

SYNOPSIS
      $moz = Mozilla::Backup->new();
      $file = $moz->backup_profile("firefox", "default");

DESCRIPTION
    This package provides a simple interface to back up the profiles of
    Mozilla-related applications such as Firefox and Thunderbird.

    More details are available in the module documentation.

Compatability with Earlier Versions
    The interface has been changed from version 0.04. Various methods
    for querying profile information were moved into the *::ProfilesIni
     module.  Code that was of the form

      $moz->method($type,$name);

    should be changed to

      $moz->type($type)->method($name);

    The older method calls should still work, but are deprecated and
    will issue warnings.

    See the module documentation and revision history (below) for more
    information.

REVISION HISTORY
    The following changes have been made since the previous release:

    * profile.ini-handling code was moded to Mozilla::ProfilesIni
      and methods were revised accordingly.

    * Added Tar plugin to produce .tar or .tar.gz archives.

    * Added ability to control compression level in .zip archives

    * Fixed bugs associated with adding new profiles and changing
      the default profile.

    * Improved profile lock detection

    * Ability to specify an exlusion list for backups and restores.

    * Added tests

    Details can be found in the Changes file.    

CAVEATS
    This module is a prototype. Use at your own risk!

    Not all of the profile types have been tested, and are implemented based
    on information gleaned from sources which may or may not be accurate.
